1. Pipelines
-----------------------
=> In Jenkins we can create 2 types of jobs;
	1. Freestyle projects ----> These projects are created based on Jenkins user interface (6 steps)
	2. Pipelines		 ----> These projects are created based on the script/code (1 step - Pipelines)

=> Types of pipeline script;
	1. Declarative script** (commonly preferred in the real-time scenarios) - Doesnt need the knowledge on programming
	2. Scripted/Groovy Scripted - Need knowledge on programming

How to write the declarative script?
--------------------------------------------
P	---> pipeline
A	---> agent
S	---> Stage(s)
S	---> Step(s)


Goto office (by 10.00AM)
Wakeup ---> Freshup ---> Breakfast ---> Vehicle ---> Office
Wakeup: Turnoff the alarm, -----
Freshup: Washroom, Paste and brush, -----

Deploy the app
Code in GitHub ----> Package ----> Deploy the code ----> End users should access the application
Code in GitHub: Install git, Clone the code
Package: configure maven, execute maven goals, check for war file

=> In a single Jenkins pipeline script, we can write multiple stages.
=> In each stage, we can write multiple steps.

Declarative script:
---------------------------
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                // Add your build steps here, e.g., sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                // Add your test steps here, e.g., sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                // Add your deploy steps here, e.g., sh 'scp target/*.war user@server:/path/to/deploy'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully.'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed.'
        }
    }
}

------------------

node {
    try {
        stage('Build') {
            echo 'Building...'
            // Add your build steps here, e.g., sh 'mvn clean install'
        }

        stage('Test') {
            echo 'Testing...'
            // Add your test steps here, e.g., sh 'mvn test'
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            echo 'Deploying...'
            // Add your deploy steps here, e.g., sh 'scp target/*.war user@server:/path/to/deploy'
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
        echo 'Pipeline failed: ' + e.message
    } finally {
        if (currentBuild.result == 'FAILURE') {
            echo 'Sending failure notification...'
            // Add your notification steps here, e.g., mail to: 'team@example.com', subject: 'Build failed', body: '...'
        } else {
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully.'
        }
    }
}

Repo URL: https://github.com/KastroVKiran/Netflix-Pipeline-Project.git

Stage 1: Cloning the code
Stage 2: Packaging the code
Stage 3: Deploying the code

Note: In real-time, the pipeline script will be available in the GitHub repo. The name of the file in which the pipeline script is available is known as "Jenkinsfile"

Trigger Builds Remotely
-------------------------------
Team Lead ----> Jenkins Admin ----> Team is working for the project ----> Ready to be built ----> An admin you haven't given any permissions to the team members to build the job. Also, you are not available.

But admin doesn't have the access to Jenkins console. How to build the job in this situations?
 

Trigger Builds Remotely ----> URL ---> 

Create a simple job with Build Trigger as "Build Trigger Remotely"

http://65.0.95.235:8080/job/trigger%20job/build?token=kastro-kiran

Once after hitting the above url, Jenkins will ask to enter the username and password. Since it is not recommended to provide the Jenkins admin creds, we have to install a plugin known as "Build Autherization Token Root"

Dashboard ---> Manage Jenkins ---> Plugins ---> Available plugins ---> Select and install "Build Authentication Token Root"

Hit the above url, so that the job will get built. And it will NOT ASK JENKINS ADMIN CREDS


Before hitting the url, make sure to build the job atleast once in the Jenkins dashboard by clicking on "BuildNow"

Once after the first build gets executed, then hit the above url
